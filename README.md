 Developed a Weather Application by using Flutter as a framework and Dart as a programming language for both
Android and iOs.
User can get the Weather condition of their current location or by entering the city name.
Get Weather Information of the location by using OpenWeatherMap Weather API.
Beautiful User Interface with some sort of Animations are used to display weather condition.
